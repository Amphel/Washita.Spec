3.1 Washita site
Washita is a powerful tool providing its customers with the ability to have their clothes, linen and home items to be washed, ironed, well folded and specially cleaned. The service offers free collection and delivery. Customers’ household laundry is picked up at their premises and delivered back minimum in two days.
Those who wish to use the service do not need register in. Therefore, this makes the application simplier to use. However, personal accounts are available on the site, where customers can find the history of their orders.
